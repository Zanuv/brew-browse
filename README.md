## Project Description

### Project Use

Brew Browse is a website designed to allow users to search for local breweries, and leave reviews based on their experiences.

### Implemented Features

The project allows the user to perform a search for local breweries by entering a city and state. Users are able to create an account.
A user is able to login, logout, and change their password. When viewing breweries a user that is logged in may leave reviews. 
The user is able to edit the reviews they have made or delete one of their reviews if they wish. 


### User Flow

Once the website is load a user is able to see the recent reviews made by other users, and search for local breweries by city. 
To leave a review a new user will need to create an account. Once a user has made an account they are able to leave a review on the breweries they search for.
A user can view their account page to see all of the reviews they have made and make desired changes.
